# Compare-Group-Members
A C# tool to detect when a member of Group 1 (for example- helpdesk administrator) is also a member of Group 2 (for example- server administrator)

Sometimes, it is possible that a low privilege user is a member of a high privileged group. 
Using this tool, we can compared the members of one group in other group to see if it is present in other high privilege group. 

Created for a challenge in [Auror Project](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=theaurorproject), where I had to check if any user of helpdesk admins is a part of Server Administrators group.
